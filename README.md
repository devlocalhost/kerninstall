# kerninstall, a kernel compiler and installer script to save you time

made in python

# NOT DONE YET!

the script works fine on my laptop. it could work on yours IF you have a i686 (32bit) cpu, and if you dont use initramfs. i will fix it soon

# requirements

+ python3
+ packages needed to compile kernel
+ ccache IF youre going to use it
+ gcc

# for more help...
```./kerninstall help```. also the kerninstall file must be on the kernel directory (where the make file is)
